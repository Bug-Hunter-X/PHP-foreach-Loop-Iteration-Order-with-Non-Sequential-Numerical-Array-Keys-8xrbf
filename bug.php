This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue in PHP related to incorrect handling of array keys when using the `foreach` loop with numerical keys.  If the array's numerical keys are not sequential, unexpected behavior might occur. 
```php
$myArray = [2 => 'apple', 0 => 'banana', 1 => 'cherry'];

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
  echo "Key: " . $key . ", Value: " . $value . "\n";
}
```
This code will output:
```
Key: 2, Value: apple
Key: 0, Value: banana
Key: 1, Value: cherry
```
Notice that the keys are not processed in the order you might expect (0, 1, 2).
